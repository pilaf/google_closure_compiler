=== Installing the Java Compiler

You can install the Closure Compiler JAR file with the following rake task:

  rake google_closure_compiler:compiler:install

That will install the compiler under:

  vendor/closure-compiler

Alternatively you can download it manually from Google's servers:

  http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip

...in which case you'll have to unzip it and tell the plugin where to look for
the JAR file manually (see below).

=== Configuration

The plugin will try to do a good job of finding the Java executable and Closure
compiler for you, but in case you need to manually specify where to find them,
you can override the defaults by creating an initializer under your
config/initializers directory.

Additionally you can specify the compilation level (options are :whitespace,
:simple or :advanced).

  # config/initializers/google_closure_compiler.rb.
  GoogleClosureCompiler.configure do |config|
    config.compiler_application_path = '/path/to/compiler.jar'
    config.java_path = '/path/to/java'
    config.compilation_level = :simple
  end
